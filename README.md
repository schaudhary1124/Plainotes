# PlaiNotes

PlaiNotes is a local-first desktop note app built with Tauri, React, and TypeScript. It combines a structured notes browser, a rich Markdown editor, sketch annotations, study cards, and multi-window support in one focused workspace.

## What it does

PlaiNotes is designed for people who want one app for writing, organizing, and reviewing notes without giving up flexibility. You can create folders, nest notes, search across your content, rename and move entries with drag and drop, and open notes in separate windows when you want a wider workspace.

The editor supports rich formatting through Milkdown, along with note-level sketching and annotations. Notes can also switch into study mode, where PlaiNotes turns compatible Markdown lines into flashcards or multiple-choice questions for quick review.

## Key features

- Local-first desktop note taking with Tauri
- Folder-based note organization

## Study syntax

PlaiNotes recognizes simple study-item lines inside Markdown notes:

```md
Q: What is the capital of France? -> A: Paris
MCQ: Which planet is known as the Red Planet? | Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter | Mars
```

In study mode, flashcards and multiple-choice items are extracted from the note and shown one at a time for review.
